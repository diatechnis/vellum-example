## Documentation

More documentation will come. In the meantime, check out `tests/Tests/ComponentTest.php` to see how to set up Vellum with a `TwigRenderer`.

The `/src/VellumExample` directory contains the classes for the various elements, and their corresponding templates are in the `/templates` directory.

Tweak the test and files to experiment.
